# Cylons Project

This is a project for my college (FIAP).  
I'm not fluent nor have vast experience in Occam, so there may be some bug code, or not be really good. That's okay...

## What this (is supposed to) do
- Make some Cylons (robots) work around, without hit wall or other Cylons
- They have some kind of laser sensor, to 'see' whats in front of them
- They can go front or turn around

## How to run
1. Install Kroc (https://github.com/concurrency/kroc)
2. kroc main.occ
3. ./main OR occbuild --run main


### Some references
Develop in a language without a community is extremely difficult. You can't just go to Stack Overflow and ask questions hehe. Here are some references I'm using to make the project.
